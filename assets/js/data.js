    summary: "I got frustrated because there was no scene in AoU where everyone tries to decide who has to bunk with who when they're at Clint's farm house. So I wrote it. And then it mutated and grew about 20k words longer than I intended. Ahem. So what basically happens is I unnecessarily re-tell and excessively explain some parts of AoU, scatter some of my own scenes around them and top it all off with an 8k sex scene.",

The notes start innocent and platonically enough, but begin to change as his friendship with Steve evolves. Basically two idiots who like each other. One doesn’t know how to use words out loud and the other is oblivious.",
